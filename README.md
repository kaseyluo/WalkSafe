# WalkSafe | CS 221 Final Project
*Authors: Kasey Luo, Daniel Guillen, Shannon Yan*

Our project aimed to use historical crime data from Manhattan, New York in order to determine the safest and most efficient path between any two intersections for a person to walk. 
For more information on our project and findings, see our final paper under `Report`.

## Quick Start

```
cd Search
python3 main.py
```
Enter the `Search` directory and run `main.py`. It will then prompt you to select any two intersections in Manhattan, New York and then run UCS, A*, and a simple greedy search in order to find a path between the two given intersections.
