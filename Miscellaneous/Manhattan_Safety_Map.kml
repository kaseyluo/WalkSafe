    <description><![CDATA[* Purple areas are the absolute worst in the city.<br>* Areas in red are unsafe, and can be considered at least somewhat "hood" on a citywide level. <br>* Areas in orange are safe to people with a reasonable amount of street smarts, and often act as buffers between the "hoods" and safe areas. <br>* Areas in yellow can be considered somewhat seedy depending on who you ask, but the only reason to avoid them would be if you are COMPLETELY lacking in street smarts. <br>* Grey areas are areas that are mostly industrial.<br>* All of the rest of the areas are all perfectly fine to anybody.<br><br>NOTE: This is all based on how the area is at night.<br><br>Disclaimer: This is an unofficial map, and so should only be used as a guide.
